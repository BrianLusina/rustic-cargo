# Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns are a category of design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms. They provide
solutions to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The main goal of creational design patterns is to
abstract the instantiation process, making it more flexible and reusable.

In this section, we will explore various creational design patterns, including:

- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Singleton
- Builder
- Prototype

Each of these patterns addresses different aspects of object creation and can be used in various scenarios to improve
code maintainability and scalability.
